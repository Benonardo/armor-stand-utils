Armor Stand Utils is a simple mod that adds a few useful functions and features to Armor Stands. It's built for 1.14.4/1.15/1.16 and requires the Fabric Loader & Fabric API to run.

Features: 

  - The Armor Stand Swap feature allows you to instantly change out your gear with an Armor Stand. Shift-right-click on a stand to swap all your armor & currently equipped items.

  - By Shift-Clicking with a Stick, you can toggle Armor Stand arms. This allows you to place items into the hand slot of the armor stand.

  - You can also Shift-Click with a Stone Slab to toggle the base plate of an armor stand.
